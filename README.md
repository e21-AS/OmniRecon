# üõ∞Ô∏è OmniRecon

**‚ÄúCommander, Glyph Info Drone is online. Ready for reconnaissance deployment.‚Äù**

OmniRecon is a modular Bash-based reconnaissance toolkit featuring Glyph ‚Äì a fictional Info Drone assistant inspired by Mass Effect‚Äôs immersive drone UIs.

This project was created as a personal learning and showcase tool, integrating:

- **Bash scripting best practices**
- Modular functions and clean structure
- Stylized prompts and outputs for immersion
- Real-world CLI reconnaissance tooling (Nmap)

## ‚ú® Features

- üõ∞Ô∏è **Immersive AI Commander prompts** (Glyph AI style)  
- üîç **Target validation** (IPv4 and ranges)  
- üì° **Basic reconnaissance module using Nmap** with optional flags:
  - Service version detection (`-sV`)
  - OS detection (`-O`)
  - Default scripts (`-sC`)
  - Aggressive timing (`-T4`)
  - Show only open ports (`--open`)
  - Enable very verbose output (`-vv`)
  - UDP Scan (`-sU`)
- ‚ùå **SIGINT handler** (Ctrl+C interruption)

## üé® Logo & Cover Credits

### ü§ñ Cover

The OmniRecon cover image was generated using **OpenAI's DALL¬∑E 3 model**.

**Prompt used:**

> "A stunning 8K ultra-detailed sci-fi desktop wallpaper. In the center, a glowing, translucent blue holographic projection of a geometric data drone, similar to Glyph from Mass Effect, is shown intensely analyzing a complex, abstract network topology or data stream. The drone emanates soft neon blue and white light, casting reflections on a sleek, dark cybernetic interface in the background. Subtle binary code flows and digital glitch effects add to the high-tech atmosphere. The overall aesthetic is clean, futuristic, and highly analytical. Text overlay: "OMNIRECON" and "GLYPH: THE INFO DRONE" in a sharp, futuristic font. --ar 16:9 --style raw"
